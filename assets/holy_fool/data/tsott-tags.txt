THE/DT MAGICIAN/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 Saw/VBD the/DT Man/NN ./.
His/PRP$* figure/NN reached/VBN from/IN earth/NN to/TO heaven/NN and/CC was/VBD clad/VBN in/IN a/DTCS purple/JJ mantle/NN ./.
He/PRPSS3 stood/VBD deep/JJ in/IN foliage/NN and/CC flowers/NNS and/CC his/PRP$* head/NN ,/, on/IN which/WDT was/VBD the/DT head-band/NN of/IN an/DTCS initiate/NN ,/, seemed/VBD to/TO disappear/VB mysteriously/RB in/IN infinity/NN ./.
Before/IN him/PRPSO3 on/IN a/DTCS cube-shaped/JJ altar/NN were/VBD four/CD symbols/NNS of/IN magic/NN ,/, the/DT sceptre/NN ,/, the/DT cup/NN ,/, the/DT sword/NN and/CC the/DT pentacle/NN ./.
His/PRP$* right/JJ hand/NN pointed/VBD to/TO heaven/NN ,/, his/PRP$* left/NN to/TO earth/NN ./.
Under/IN his/PRP$* mantle/NN he/PRPSS3 wore/VBD a/DTCS white/JJ tunic/NN girded/VBD with/IN a/DTCS serpent/NN swallowing/VBG its/PRP$* tail/NN ./.
His/PRP$* face/NN was/VBD luminous/JJ and/CC serene/JJ ,/, and/CC ,/, when/WRB his/PRP$* eyes/NNS met/VBD mine/NN ,/, I/PRPSS1 felt/VBD that/IN he/PRPSS3 saw/VBD most/JJS intimate/JJ recesses/NNS of/IN my/PRP$JJ soul/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD myself/PRPSR1 reflected/VBD in/IN him/PRPSO3 as/IN in/IN a/DTCS mirror/NN and/CC in/IN his/PRP$* eyes/NNS I/PRPSS1 seemed/VBD to/TO look/VB upon/IN myself/PRPSR1 ./.
And/CC I/PRPSS1 heard/VBN a/DTCS voice/NN saying/VBG ./.
Look/VB ,/, this/DT*S is/VBZ the/DT Great_Magician/NNP !/!
With/IN his/PRP$* hands/NNS he/PRPSS3 unites/VBZ heaven/NN and/CC earth/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT four/CD elements/NNS that/IN form/NN the/DT world/NN are/are controlled/VBN by/IN him/PRPSO3 ./.
The/DT four/CD symbols/NNS before/IN him/PRPSO3 are/are the/DT four/CD letters/NNS of/IN the/DT name/NN of/IN God/NNP ,/, the/DT signs/NNS of/IN the/DT four/CD elements/NNS ,/, fire/NN ,/, water/NN ,/, air/NN ,/, earth/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 trembled/VBD before/IN the/DT depth/NN of/IN the/DT mysteries/NNS A/NNP touched/VBN ./.
The/DT words/NNS I/PRPSS1 heard/VBN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB littered/VBN by/IN the/DT Great/NNP Magician/NN himself/PRPSR3 ,/, and/CC it/PRPS*3 was/VBD as/IN though/IN he/PRPSS3 spoke/VBD in/IN me/PRPSO1 ./.
I/PRPSS1 was/VBD in/IN deep/JJ trepidation/NN and/CC at/IN moment/NN I/PRPSS1 felt/VBD there/EX was/VBD nothing/NN ,/, before/IN me/PRPSO1 except/IN the/DT blue/JJ sky/NN ./.
but/CC within/IN me/PRPSO1 a/DTCS window/NN opened/VBD through/IN which/WDT I/PRPSS1 could/MD see/VB unearthly/JJ things/NNS ./.
and/CC hear/VB unearthly/JJ words/NNS ./.
THE/DT FOOL/NN ./.
And/CC I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD another/DT+JJ man/NN ./.
Tired/JJ and/CC lame/JJ he/PRPSS3 dragged/VBN himself/PRPSR3 along/IN the/DT dusty/JJ road/NN ,/, across/IN the/DT deserted/VBN plain/JJ under/IN the/DT scorching/JJ rays/NNS of/IN the/DT sun/NN ./.
He/PRPSS3 glanced/VBD sidelong/JJ with/IN foolish/JJ ,/, staring/VBG eyes/NNS ,/, a/DTCS half/PDT smile/NN ,/, half/PDT leer/NN on/IN his/PRP$* face/NN ./.
he/PRPSS3 knew/VBD not/RB where/WRB he/PRPSS3 went/VBD ,/, but/CC was/VBD absorbed/VBN in/IN his/PRP$* chimerical/JJ dreams/NNS which/WDT ran/VBD constantly/RB in/IN the/DT same/JJ circle/NN ./.
His/PRP$* fool/NN '/" s/PRP$S cap/NN was/VBD put/VB on/IN wrong/JJ side/NN front/NN ,/, his/PRP$* garments/NNS were/VBD torn/VBN in/IN the/DT back/RB ./.
a/DTCS wild/JJ lynx/NN with/IN glowing/VBG eyes/NNS sprang/VBD upon/IN him/PRPSO3 from/IN behind/IN a/DTCS rock/NN and/CC buried/VBN her/PRP$JJ teeth/NNS in/IN his/PRP$* flesh/NN ./.
He/PRPSS3 stumbled/VBD ,/, nearly/RB fell/VBD ,/, but/CC continued/VBD to/TO drag/NN himself/PRPSR3 along/IN ,/, all/DT** the/DT time/NN holding/VBG on/IN his/PRP$* shoulder/NN a/DTCS bag/NN containing/VBG useless/JJ things/NNS ,/, which/WDT he/PRPSS3 ,/, in/IN his/PRP$* stupidity/NN ,/, carried/VBD wherever/WRB he/PRPSS3 went/VBD ./.
Before/IN him/PRPSO3 a/DTCS crevice/NN crossed/VBD the/DT road/NN and/CC a/DTCS deep/JJ precipice/NN awaited/VBD the/DT foolish/JJ wanderer/NN ./.
Then/RB a/DTCS huge/JJ crocodile/NN with/IN open/JJ mouth/NN crawled/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT precipice/NN ./.
Look/VB !/!
This/DT*S is/VBZ the/DT same/JJ man/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 felt/VBD my/PRP$JJ head/NN whirl/VB ./.
What/WP has/VBZ he/PRPSS3 in/IN the/DT bag/NN ?/?
I/PRPSS1 inquired/VBD ,/, not/RB knowing/VBG why/WRB I/PRPSS1 asked/VBD ./.
And/CC after/IN a/DTCS long/JJ silence/NN the/DT voice/NN replied/VBD ./.
The/DT four/CD magic/NN symbols/NNS ,/, the/DT sceptre/NN ,/, the/DT cup/NN ,/, the/DT sword/NN and/CC the/DT pentacle/NN ./.
The/DT fool/NN always/RB carries/VBZ them/PRPPO3 ,/, although/IN he/PRPSS3 has/VBZ long/JJ since/IN forgotten/VBN what/WP they/PRPPS3 mean/VB ./.
Nevertheless/RB they/PRPPS3 belong/VB to/TO him/PRPSO3 ,/, even/RB though/IN he/PRPSS3 does/VBZ not/RB know/VB their/PRP$JJ use/NN ./.
The/DT symbols/NNS have/have not/RB lost/VBD their/PRP$JJ power/NN ,/, they/PRPPS3 retain/VB it/PRPS*3 in/IN themselves/PRP*R3 ./.
THE/DT HIGH_PRIESTESS/NNP ./.
When/WRB I/PRPSS1 lifted/VBD the/DT first/JJ veil/NN and/CC entered/VBD the/DT outer/JJ court/NN of/IN the/DT Temple/NNP of/IN Initiation/NN ,/, I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD in/IN half/JJ darkness/NN the/DT figure/NN of/IN a/DTCS woman/NN sitting/VBG on/IN a/DTCS high/JJ throne/NN between/IN two/CD pillars/NNS of/IN the/DT temple/NN ,/, one/CD white/JJ ,/, and/CC one/CD black/JJ ./.
Mystery/NN emanated/VBD from/IN her/PRPSO3 and/CC was/VBD about/IN her/PRPSO3 ./.
Sacred/JJ symbols/NNS shone/VBD on/IN her/PRP$JJ green/JJ dress/NN ./.
on/IN her/PRP$JJ head/NN was/VBD a/DTCS golden/JJ tiara/NN surmounted/VBD by/IN a/DTCS two-horned/JJ moon/NN ./.
on/IN her/PRP$JJ knees/NNS she/PRPSS3 held/VBN two/CD crossed/VBD keys/NNS and/CC an/DTCS open/JJ book/NN ./.
Between/IN the/DT two/CD pillars/NNS behind/IN the/DT woman/NN hung/VBD another/DT+JJ veil/NN all/DT** embroidered/VBN with/IN green/JJ leaves/VBZ and/CC fruit/NN of/IN pomegranate/NN ./.
And/CC a/DTCS voice/NN said/VBD ./.
To/TO enter/VB the/DT Temple/NNP one/CD must/MD lift/VB the/DT second/JJ veil/NN and/CC pass/VB between/IN the/DT two/CD pillars/NNS ./.
And/CC to/TO pass/VB thus/RB ,/, one/CD must/MD obtain/VB possession/NN of/IN the/DT keys/NNS ,/, read/VB the/DT book/NN and/CC understand/VB the/DT symbols/NNS ./.
Are/Are you/PRP*2 able/JJ to/TO do/do this/DT*S ?/?
I/PRPSS1 would/MD like/IN to/TO be/VB able/JJ ,/, I/PRPSS1 said/VBD ./.
Then/RB the/DT woman/NN turned/VBD her/PRP$JJ face/NN to/TO me/PRPSO1 and/CC looked/VBD into/IN my/PRP$JJ eyes/NNS without/IN speaking/VBG ./.
This/DT*S is/VBZ the/DT Hall/NNP of/IN Wisdom/NNP ./.
No/DT one/PRPS*3 can/MD reveal/VB it/PRPS*3 ,/, no/DT one/PRPS*3 can/MD hide/VB it/PRPS*3 ./.
Like/IN a/DTCS flower/NN it/PRPS*3 must/MD grow/VB and/CC bloom/NN in/IN thy/JJ soul/NN ./.
if/IF thou/PRPS2 wouldst/VBP plant/NN the/DT seed/VBN of/IN this/DT*S flower/NN in/IN thy/JJ soul/NN ,/, learn/VB to/TO discern/VB the/DT real/JJ from/IN the/DT false/JJ ./.
Listen/VB only/RB to/TO the/DT Voice/NNP that/IN is/VBZ soundless/JJ ./.
Look/VB only/RB on/IN that/IN which/WDT is/VBZ invisible/JJ ,/, and/CC remember/VB that/IN in/IN thee/PRPO2 thyself/PRPSR2 ,/, is/VBZ the/DT Temple/NNP and/CC the/DT gate/NN to/TO it/PRPS*3 ,/, and/CC the/DT mystery/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT initiation/NN ./.
THE/DT WORLD/NN ./.
An/DTCS unexpected/JJ vision/NN appeared/VBD to/TO me/PRPSO1 ./.
A/DTCS circle/NN not/RB unlike/IN a/DTCS wreath/NN woven/VBN from/IN rainbow/NN and/CC lightnings/NNS ,/, whirled/VBD from/IN heaven/NN to/TO earth/NN with/IN a/DTCS stupendous/JJ ,/, velocity/NN ,/, blinding/JJ me/PRPSO1 by/IN its/PRP$* brilliance/NN ./.
And/CC amidst/IN this/DT*S light/NN and/CC fire/NN I/PRPSS1 heard/VBN music/NN and/CC soft/JJ singing/VBG ,/, thunderclaps/NNS and/CC the/DT roar/NN of/IN a/DTCS tempest/NN ,/, the/DT rumble/NN of/IN falling/VBG mountains/NNS and/CC earthquakes/NNS ./.
The/DT circle/NN whirled/VBD with/IN a/DTCS terrifying/JJ noise/NN ,/, touching/VBG the/DT sun/NN and/CC the/DT earth/NN ,/, and/CC ,/, in/IN the/DT centre/NN of/IN it/PRPS*3 I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD the/DT naked/JJ ,/, dancing/VBG figure/NN of/IN a/DTCS beautiful/JJ young/JJ woman/NN ,/, enveloped/VBN by/IN a/DTCS light/NN ,/, transparent/JJ scarf/NN ,/, in/IN her/PRP$JJ hand/NN she/PRPSS3 held/VBN a/DTCS magic/NN wand/NN ./.
Presently/RB the/DT four/CD apocalyptical/JJ beasts/NNS began/VBD to/TO appear/VB on/IN the/DT edges/NNS of/IN the/DT circle/NN ./.
one/CD1 with/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN a/DTCS lion/NN ,/, another/DT+JJ with/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN a/DTCS man/NN ,/, the/DT third/JJ ,/, of/IN an/DTCS eagle/NN and/CC the/DT fourth/JJ ,/, of/IN a/DTCS bull/NN ./.
The/DT vision/NN disappeared/VBD as/IN suddenly/RB as/IN it/PRPS*3 appeared/VBD ./.
A/DTCS weird/JJ silence/NN fell/VBD on/IN me/PRPSO1 ./.
What/WP does/VBZ it/PRPS*3 mean/VB ?/?
I/PRPSS1 asked/VBD in/IN wonder/NN ./.
It/PRPS*3 is/VBZ the/DT image/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN ,/, the/DT voice/NN said/VBD ,/, but/CC it/PRPS*3 can/MD be/VB understood/VBN only/RB after/IN the/DT Temple/NNP has/VBZ been/VBN entered/VBD ./.
This/DT*S is/VBZ a/DTCS vision/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN in/IN the/DT circle/NN of/IN Time/NNP ,/, amidst/IN the/DT four/CD principles/NNS ./.
But/CC thou/PRPS2 seest/VBP differently/RB because/CC thou/PRPS2 seest/VBP the/DT world/NN outside/IN thyself/PRPSR2 ./.
Learn/VB to/TO see/VB it/PRPS*3 in/IN thyself/PRPSR2 and/CC thou/PRPS2 wilt/MD understand/VB the/DT infinite/JJ essence/NN ,/, hidden/VBN in/IN all/DT** illusory/JJ forms/NNS ./.
Understand/VB that/IN the/DT world/NN which/WDT thou/PRPS2 knowest/VBP is/VBZ only/RB one/CD1 of/IN the/DT aspects/NNS of/IN the/DT infinite/JJ world/NN ,/, and/CC things/NNS and/CC phenomena/NNS are/are merely/RB hierolgyphics/NNS of/IN deeper/JJR ideas/NNS ./.
THE/DT EMPRESS/NNP ./.
I/PRPSS1 felt/VBD the/DT breath/NN of/IN the/DT spring/NN ,/, and/CC accompanying/VBG the/DT fragrance/NN of/IN violets/NNS and/CC lilies-of-the-valley/NN I/PRPSS1 heard/VBN the/DT tender/NN singing/VBG of/IN elves/NNS ./.
Rivulets/NNS murmured/VBD ,/, the/DT treetops/NNS rustled/VBN ,/, the/DT grasses/NNS whispered/VBD ,/, innumerable/JJ birds/NNS sang/VBD in/IN choruses/NNS and/CC bees/NNS hummed/VBD ./.
everywhere/PRP I/PRPSS1 felt/VBD the/DT breathing/VBG of/IN joyful/JJ ,/, living/JJ Nature/NNP ./.
The/DT sun/NN shone/VBD tenderly/RB and/CC softly/RB and/CC a/DTCS little/JJ white/JJ cloud/NN hung/VBD over/IN the/DT woods/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT midst/NN of/IN a/DTCS green/JJ meadow/NN where/WRB primroses/NNS bloomed/VBD ,/, I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD the/DT Empress/NNP seated/VBN on/IN a/DTCS throne/NN covered/VBN with/IN ivy/NN and/CC lilacs/NNS ./.
A/DTCS green/JJ wreath/NN adorned/VBN her/PRP$JJ golden/JJ hair/NN and/CC ,/, above/IN her/PRP$JJ head/NN ,/, shone/VBD twelve/CD stars/NNS ./.
Behind/IN her/PRPSO3 rose/VBD two/CD snowy/JJ wings/NNS and/CC in/IN her/PRP$JJ hands/NNS she/PRPSS3 held/VBN a/DTCS sceptre/NN ./.
All/DT** around/IN ,/, beneath/IN the/DT sweet/JJ smile/NN of/IN the/DT Empress/NNP ,/, flowers/NNS and/CC buds/NNS opened/VBD their/PRP$JJ dewy/JJ ,/, green/JJ leaves/NNS ./.
Her/PRP$JJ whole/JJ dress/NN was/VBD covered/VBN with/IN them/PRPPO3 as/IN though/IN each/DTCS newly/RB opened/VBD flower/NN were/VBD reflected/VBD in/IN it/PRPS*3 or/CC had/VBD engraved/VBN itself/PRPSR3 thereon/RB and/CC thus/RB become/VB part/NN of/IN her/PRP$JJ garment/NN ./.
The/DT sign/NN of/IN Venus/NNP ,/, the/DT goddess/NN of/IN love/NN ,/, was/VBD chiselled/VBD on/IN her/PRP$JJ marble/NN throne/NN ./.
Queen/NNP of/IN life/NN ,/, I/PRPSS1 said/VBD ,/, why/WRB is/VBZ it/PRPS*3 so/RB bright/JJ and/CC joyful/JJ all/DT** about/IN you/PRP*2 ?/?
Do/Do you/PRP*2 not/RB know/VB of/IN the/DT grey/JJ ,/, weary/JJ autumn/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT cold/JJ ,/, white/JJ winter/NN ?/?
Do/Do you/PRP*2 not/RB know/VB of/IN death/NN and/CC graveyards/NNS with/IN black/JJ graves/NNS ,/, damp/JJ and/CC cold/JJ ?/?
How/WRB can/MD you/PRP*2 smile/VB so/RB joyfully/RB on/IN the/DT opening/VBG flowers/NNS ,/, when/WRB everything/PRP is/VBZ destined/VBN to/TO death/NN ,/, even/RB that/IN which/WDT has/VBZ not/RB yet/RB been/VBN born/VBN ?/?
For/IN answer/NN the/DT Empress/NNP looked/VBD on/IN me/PRPSO1 still/RB smiling/VBG and/CC ,/, under/IN the/DT influence/NN of/IN that/IN smile/NN ,/, I/PRPSS1 suddenly/RB felt/VBD a/DTCS flower/NN of/IN some/DT clear/JJ understanding/VBG open/JJ in/IN my/PRP$JJ heart/NN ./.
JUDGMENT/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD an/DTCS ice/JJ plain/NN ,/, and/CC on/IN the/DT horizon/NN ,/, a/DTCS chain/NN of/IN snowy/JJ mountains/NNS ./.
A/DTCS cloud/NN appeared/VBD and/CC began/VBD to/TO grow/VB until/IN it/PRPS*3 covered/VBN a/DTCS quarter/NN of/IN the/DT sky/NN ./.
Two/CD fiery/JJ wings/NNS suddenly/RB expanded/VBN in/IN the/DT cloud/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRPSS1 knew/VBD that/IN I/PRPSS1 beheld/VBD the/DT messenger/NN of/IN the/DT Empress/NNP ./.
He/PRPSS3 raised/VBN a/DTCS trumpet/NN and/CC blew/VBD through/IN it/PRPS*3 vibrant/JJ ,/, powerful/JJ tones/NNS ./.
The/DT plain/NN quivered/VBD in/IN response/NN to/TO him/PRPSO3 and/CC the/DT mountains/NNS loudly/RB rolled/VBD their/PRP$JJ echoes/NNS ./.
One/CD1 after/IN another/DT+JJ ,/, graves/NNS opened/VBD in/IN the/DT plain/JJ and/CC out/IN of/IN them/PRPPO3 came/VBD men/NNS and/CC women/NNS ,/, old/JJ and/CC young/JJ ,/, and/CC children/NNS ./.
They/PRPPS3 stretched/VBD out/IN their/PRP$JJ arms/NNS toward/IN the/DT Messenger/NNP of/IN the/DT Empress/NNP and/CC to/TO catch/VB the/DT sounds/NNS of/IN his/PRP$* trumpet/NN ./.
And/CC in/IN its/PRP$* tones/NNS I/PRPSS1 felt/VBD the/DT smile/NN of/IN the/DT Empress/NNP and/CC in/IN the/DT opening/VBG graves/NNS I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD the/DT opening/VBG flowers/NNS whose/WP$ fragrance/NN seemed/VBD to/TO be/VB wafted/VBD by/IN the/DT outstretched/VBN arms/NNS ./.
Then/RB I/PRPSS1 understood/VBN the/DT mystery/NN of/IN birth/NN in/IN death/NN ./.
THE/DT EMPEROR/NN ./.
After/IN I/PRPSS1 learned/VBD the/DT first/JJ three/CD numbers/NNS I/PRPSS1 was/VBD given/VBN to/TO understand/VB the/DT Great/NNP Law/NNP of/IN Four/CD ,/, the/DT alpha/NN and/CC omega/NN of/IN all/DT** ./.
I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD the/DT Emperor/NNP on/IN a/DTCS lofty/JJ stone/NN throne/NN ,/, ornamented/VBN by/IN four/CD rams/NNS '/" heads/NNS ./.
On/IN his/PRP$* forehead/NN shone/VBD a/DTCS golden/JJ helmet/NN ./.
His/PRP$* white/JJ beard/NN fell/VBD over/IN a/DTCS purple/JJ mantle/NN ./.
In/IN one/CD1 hand/NN he/PRPSS3 held/VBN a/DTCS sphere/NN ,/, the/DT symbol/NN of/IN his/PRP$* possession/NN ,/, and/CC in/IN the/DT other/JJ ,/, a/DTCS sceptre/NN in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN an/DTCS Egyptian/JJ cross/VB ,/, the/DT sign/NN of/IN his/PRP$* power/NN over/IN birth/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 am/am The/DT Great/NNP Law/NNP ,/, the/DT Emperor/NNP said/VBD ./.

The/DT four/CD letters/NNS of/IN his/PRP$* name/NN are/are in/IN me/PRPSO1 and/CC I/PRPSS1 am/am in/IN all/DT** ./.

For/IN him/PRPSO3 who/WP knows/VBZ how/WRB to/TO see/VB me/PRPSO1 there/EX are/are no/DT mysteries/NNS on/IN earth/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 am/am the/DT great/JJ Pentacle/NNP ./.
As/IN the/DT earth/NN encloses/VBZ in/IN itself/PRPSR3 fire/NN ,/, water/NN and/CC air/NN ./.
as/IN the/DT fourth/JJ letter/NN of/IN the/DT Name/NN encloses/VBZ in/IN itself/PRPSR3 the/DT first/JJ three/CD and/CC becomes/VBZ itself/PRPSR3 the/DT first/JJ ,/, so/RB my/PRP$JJ sceptre/NN encloses/VBZ the/DT complete/JJ triangle/NN and/CC bears/VBZ in/IN itself/PRPSR3 the/DT seed/VBN of/IN a/DTCS new/JJ triangle/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 am/am the/DT Logos/NNP in/IN the/DT full/JJ aspect/NN and/CC the/DT beginning/VBG of/IN a/DTCS new/JJ Logos/NNP ./.
And/CC while/IN the/DT Emperor/NNP spoke/VBD ,/, his/PRP$* helmet/NN shone/VBD brighter/JJR and/CC brighter/JJR ,/, and/CC his/PRP$* golden/JJ armour/NN gleamed/VBD beneath/IN his/PRP$* mantle/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 could/MD not/RB bear/VB his/PRP$* glory/NN and/CC I/PRPSS1 lowered/VBD my/PRP$JJ eyes/NNS ./.
When/WRB I/PRPSS1 tried/VBD to/TO lift/VB them/PRPPO3 again/RB a/DTCS vivid/JJ light/NN of/IN radiant/JJ fire/NN was/VBD before/IN me/PRPSO1 ,/, and/CC I/PRPSS1 prostrated/VBD myself/PRPSR1 and/CC made/VBN obeisance/NN to/TO the/DT Fiery/JJ Word/NNP ./.
THE/DT SUN/NNP ./.
As/IN soon/RB as/IN I/PRPSS1 perceived/VBN the/DT Sun/NNP ,/, I/PRPSS1 understood/VBN that/IN It/PRPS*3 ,/, Itself/PRPSR3 ,/, is/VBZ the/DT expression/NN of/IN the/DT Fiery/JJ Word/NNP and/CC the/DT sign/NN of/IN the/DT Emperor/NNP ./.
The/DT great/JJ luminary/NN shone/VBD with/IN an/DTCS intense/JJ heat/NN upon/IN the/DT large/JJ golden/JJ heads/NNS of/IN sun-flowers/NNS ./.
And/CC I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD a/DTCS naked/JJ boy/NN ,/, whose/WP$ head/NN was/VBD wreathed/VBN with/IN roses/NNS ,/, galloping/VBG on/IN a/DTCS white/JJ horse/NN and/CC waving/VBG a/DTCS bright-red/JJ banner/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 shut/VBN my/PRP$JJ eyes/NNS for/IN a/DTCS moment/NN and/CC when/WRB I/PRPSS1 opened/VBD them/PRPPO3 again/RB I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD that/IN each/DTCS ray/NN of/IN the/DT Sun/NNP is/VBZ the/DT sceptre/NN of/IN the/DT Emperor/NNP and/CC bears/VBZ life/NN ./.
And/CC I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD how/WRB under/IN the/DT concentration/NN of/IN these/DT*P rays/NNS the/DT mystic/JJ flowers/NNS of/IN the/DT waters/NNS open/JJ and/CC receive/VB the/DT rays/NNS into/IN themselves/PRP*R3 and/CC how/WRB all/DT** Nature/NNP is/VBZ constantly/RB born/VBN from/IN the/DT union/NN of/IN two/CD principles/NNS ./.
THE/DT CHARIOT/NNP ./.
I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD a/DTCS chariot/NN drawn/VBN by/IN two/CD sphinxes/NNS ,/, one/CD1 white/JJ ,/, the/DT other/JJ black/JJ ./.
Four/CD pillars/NNS supported/VBN a/DTCS blue/JJ canopy/NN ,/, on/IN which/WDT were/VBD scattered/VBN five-pointed/JJ stars/NNS ./.

A/DTCS desolate/JJ plain/NN stretched/VBD before/IN me/PRPSO1 ./.

Under/IN her/PRP$JJ wavering/VBG light/NN the/DT shadows/NNS lived/VBD their/PRP$JJ own/JJ peculiar/JJ life/NN ./.

A/DTCS large/JJ black/JJ crab/NN crawled/VBD out/IN of/IN the/DT rivulet/NN into/IN the/DT sands/NNS ./.
A/DTCS heavy/JJ ,/, cold/JJ dew/NN was/VBD falling/VBG ./.

In/IN this/DT*S pale/JJ moonlight/NN I/PRPSS1 seemed/VBD to/TO feel/VB the/DT presence/NN of/IN apparitions/NNS ./.

THE/DT LOVERS/NNS ./.
I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD a/DTCS blooming/VBG garden/NN in/IN a/DTCS green/JJ valley/NN ,/, surrounded/VBN by/IN soft/JJ blue/JJ hills/NNS ./.
In/IN the/DT garden/NN I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD a/DTCS Man/NN and/CC a/DTCS Woman/NNP naked/JJ and/CC beautiful/JJ ./.
They/PRPPS3 loved/VBD each/DTCS other/JJ and/CC their/PRP$JJ Love/NNP was/VBD their/PRP$JJ service/NN to/TO the/DT Great/NNP Conception/NNP ,/, a/DTCS prayer/NN and/CC a/DTCS sacrifice/NN ./.
through/IN It/PRPS*3 they/PRPPS3 communed/VBD with/IN God/NNP ,/, through/IN It/PRPS*3 they/PRPPS3 received/VBD the/DT highest/JJS revelations/NNS ./.
in/IN Its/PRP$* light/NN the/DT deepest/JJS truths/NNS came/VBD to/TO them/PRPPO3 ./.
the/DT magic/JJ world/NN opened/VBD its/PRP$* gate/NN ./.
elves/NNS ,/, undines/NNS ,/, sylphs/NNS and/CC gnomes/NNS came/VBD openly/RB to/TO them/PRPPO3 ./.
the/DT three/CD kingdoms/NNS of/IN nature/NN ,/, the/DT mineral/JJ ,/, plant/JJ and/CC animal/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT four/CD elements/NNS ,/, fire/NN ,/, water/NN ,/, air/NN and/CC earth/NN ,/, served/VBN them/PRPPO3 ./.
Through/IN their/PRP$JJ Love/NNP they/PRPPS3 saw/VBD the/DT mystery/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN '/" s/PRP$S equilibrium/NN ,/, and/CC that/IN they/PRPPS3 themselves/PRP*R3 were/VBD a/DTCS symbol/NN and/CC expression/NN of/IN this/DT*S balance/NN ./.
Two/CD triangles/NNS united/VBN in/IN them/PRPPO3 into/IN a/DTCS six-pointed/JJ star/NN ./.
Two/CD magnets/NNS melted/VBN into/IN an/DTCS ellipsis/NN ./.
They/PRPPS3 were/VBD two/CD ./.
The/DT third/JJ was/VBD the/DT Unknown/NNP Future/NNP ./.
The/DT three/CD made/VBN One/NNP ./.
I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD the/DT woman/NN looking/VBG out/IN upon/IN the/DT world/NN as/IN though/IN enraptured/VBD with/IN its/PRP$* beauty/NN ./.
And/CC from/IN the/DT tree/NN on/IN which/WDT ripened/VBD golden/JJ fruit/NN I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD a/DTCS serpent/NN creep/VB ./.
It/PRPS*3 whispered/VBD in/IN the/DT woman/NN '/" s/PRP$S ear/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD her/PRPSO3 listening/VBG ,/, smiling/VBG at/IN first/JJ suspiciously/RB ,/, then/RB with/IN curiosity/NN which/WDT merged/VBN into/IN joy/NN ./.
Then/RB I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD her/PRPSO3 speak/VB to/TO the/DT man/NN ./.

This/DT*S picture/NN you/PRP*2 see/VB ,/, is/VBZ a/DTCS picture/NN of/IN temptation/NN and/CC fall/NN ,/, said/VBD the/DT voice/NN ./.
What/WP constitutes/VBZ the/DT Fall/NNP ?/?
Do/Do you/PRP*2 understand/VB its/PRP$* nature/NN ?/?
Life/NNP is/VBZ so/RB good/JJ ,/, I/PRPSS1 said/VBD ,/, and/CC the/DT world/NN so/RB beautiful/JJ ,/, and/CC this/DT*S man/NN and/CC woman/NN wanted/VBD to/TO believe/VBP in/IN the/DT reality/NN of/IN the/DT world/NN and/CC of/IN themselves/PRP*R3 ./.
They/PRPPS3 wanted/VBD to/TO forget/VB service/NN and/CC take/VB from/IN the/DT world/NN what/WP it/PRPS*3 can/MD give/VB ./.
So/RB they/PRPPS3 made/VBN a/DTCS distinction/NN between/IN themselves/PRP*R3 and/CC the/DT world/NN ./.
They/PRPPS3 said/VBD ,/, We/PRPPS1 are/are here/RB ,/, the/DT world/NN is/VBZ there/EX ./.
And/CC the/DT world/NN separated/VBN from/IN them/PRPPO3 and/CC became/VBD hostile/JJ ./.
Yes/UH ,/, said/VBD the/DT Voice/NNP ,/, this/DT*S is/VBZ true/JJ ./.
The/DT everlasting/JJ mistake/NN with/IN men/NNS is/VBZ that/IN they/PRPPS3 see/VB the/DT fall/NN in/IN love/NN ./.
But/CC Love/NNP is/VBZ not/RB a/DTCS fall/NN ,/, it/PRPS*3 is/VBZ a/DTCS soaring/VBG above/IN an/DTCS abyss/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT higher/JJR the/DT flight/NN ,/, the/DT more/JJR beautiful/JJ and/CC alluring/JJ appears/VBZ the/DT earth/NN ./.
But/CC that/IN wisdom/NN ,/, which/WDT crawls/NNS on/IN earth/NN ,/, advises/VBZ belief/NN in/IN the/DT earth/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT present/JJ ./.
This/DT*S is/VBZ the/DT Temptation/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT man/NN and/CC woman/NN yielded/VBD to/TO it/PRPS*3 ./.
They/PRPPS3 dropped/VBD from/IN the/DT eternal/JJ realms/NNS and/CC submitted/VBN to/TO time/NN and/CC death/NN ./.
The/DT balance/NN was/VBD disturbed/VBN ./.
The/DT fairyland/NN was/VBD closed/VBD upon/IN them/PRPPO3 ./.
The/DT elves/NNS ,/, undines/NNS ,/, sylphs/NNS and/CC gnomes/NNS became/VBD invisible/JJ ./.
The/DT Face/NNP of/IN God/NNP ceased/VBD to/TO reveal/VB Itself/PRPSR3 to/TO them/PRPPO3 ,/, and/CC all/DT** things/NNS appeared/VBD upside/RB down/RB ./.
This/DT*S Fall/NNP ,/, this/DT*S first/JJ sin/NN of/IN man/NN ,/, repeats/VBZ itself/PRPSR3 perpetually/RB ,/, because/CC man/NN continues/VBZ to/TO believe/VBP in/IN his/PRP$* separateness/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT Present/NNP ./.
And/CC only/RB by/IN means/VBZ of/IN great/JJ suffering/VBG can/MD he/PRPSS3 liberate/VB himself/PRPSR3 from/IN the/DT control/NN of/IN time/NN and/CC return/NN to/TO Eternity/NN ,/, leave/VB darkness/NN and/CC return/NN to/TO Light/NNP ./.
THE/DT STAR/NN ./.
A/DTCS strange/JJ emotion/NN seized/VBN me/PRPSO1 ./.
A/DTCS fiery/JJ trembling/VBG ran/VBD in/IN waves/NNS through/IN all/DT** my/PRP$JJ body/NN ./.
My/PRP$JJ heart/NN quickened/VBD its/PRP$* beating/VBG ,/, tumult/NN agitated/VBD my/PRP$JJ mind/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 felt/VBD that/IN I/PRPSS1 was/VBD surrounded/VBN by/IN portentous/JJ mysteries/NNS ./.
And/CC presently/RB shafts/NNS of/IN Light/NNP penetrated/VBN my/PRP$JJ being/VBG and/CC illuminated/VBN many/JJ things/NNS before/IN in/IN darkness/NN ,/, whose/WP$ existence/NN even/RB I/PRPSS1 had/VBD never/RB suspected/VBN ./.
Veils/NNS vanished/VBD of/IN which/WDT I/PRPSS1 had/VBD been/VBN before/IN unaware/JJ ./.
Voices/NNS spoke/VBD to/TO me/PRPSO1 ./.
And/CC suddenly/RB all/DT** my/PRP$JJ former/JJ knowledge/NN took/VBD a/DTCS new/JJ and/CC different/JJ meaning/VBG ./.
I/PRPSS1 discovered/VBN unexpected/JJ correlations/NNS in/IN things/NNS which/WDT hitherto/RB I/PRPSS1 had/VBD thought/VBD foreign/JJ to/TO each/DTCS other/JJ ./.
Objects/NNS distant/JJ and/CC different/JJ from/IN one/CD1 another/DT+JJ appeared/VBN near/IN and/CC similar/JJ ./.
The/DT facts/NNS of/IN the/DT world/NN arranged/VBN themselves/PRP*R3 before/IN my/PRP$JJ eyes/NNS according/VBG to/TO a/DTCS new/JJ pattern/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT sky/NN there/EX appeared/VBD an/DTCS enormous/JJ star/NN surrounded/VBN by/IN seven/CD smaller/JJR stars/NNS ./.
Their/PRP$JJ rays/NNS intermingled/VBD ,/, filling/VBG space/NN with/IN immeasurable/JJ radiance/NN and/CC splendour/NN ./.
Where/WRB ./. ./. ./.
all/DT** things/NNS are/are diaphanous/JJ ./.
and/CC nothing/NN is/VBZ dark/JJ and/CC resisting/VBN ,/, but/CC everything/NN is/VBZ apparent/JJ to/TO every/DTCS one/CD1 internally/RB and/CC throughout/IN ./.
For/IN light/NN everywhere/RB meets/VBZ with/IN light/NN ,/, since/IN everything/NN contains/VBZ all/DT** things/NNS in/IN itself/PRPSR3 ,/, and/CC again/RB sees/VBZ all/DT** things/NNS in/IN another/DT+JJ ./.
So/RB that/IN all/DT** things/NNS are/are everywhere/RB ,/, and/CC all/DT** is/VBZ all/DT** ./.
Each/DTCS thing/NN likewise/RB is/VBZ everything/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT splendour/NN there/EX is/VBZ infinite/JJ ./.
For/IN everything/VBG there/EX is/VBZ great/JJ ,/, since/IN even/RB that/IN which/WDT is/VBZ small/JJ is/VBZ great/JJ ./.
The/DT sun/NN too/RB ,/, which/WDT is/VBZ there/EX ,/, is/VBZ all/DT** the/DT stars/NNS ./.
and/CC again/RB each/DTCS star/NN is/VBZ the/DT sun/NN and/CC all/DT** the/DT stars/NNS ./.
In/IN each/DTCS however/RB ,/, a/DTCS different/JJ property/NN predominates/VBZ ,/, but/CC at/IN the/DT same/JJ time/NN all/DT** things/NNS are/are visible/JJ in/IN each/DTCS ./.
Motion/NNP likewise/RB there/EX is/VBZ pure/JJ ./.
for/IN motion/NN is/VBZ not/RB confounded/VBD by/IN a/DTCS mover/NN different/JJ from/IN it/PRPS*3 ./.
Permanency/NN also/RB suffers/VBZ no/DT change/NN of/IN its/PRP$* nature/NN ,/, because/CC it/PRPS*3 is/VBZ not/RB mingled/VBD with/IN the/DT unstable/JJ ./.
And/CC the/DT beautiful/JJ there/EX is/VBZ beautiful/JJ ,/, because/CC it/PRPS*3 does/VBZ not/RB subsist/VB in/IN beauty/NN ./.
Each/DTCS thing/NN ,/, too/RB ,/, is/VBZ there/EX established/VBN ,/, not/RB as/IN in/IN a/DTCS foreign/JJ land/NN ,/, but/CC the/DT seat/NN of/IN each/DTCS thing/NN is/VBZ that/IN which/WDT each/DTCS thing/NN is/VBZ ./. ./. ./. ./. ./.
Nor/CC is/VBZ the/DT thing/NN itself/PRPSR3 different/JJ from/IN the/DT place/NN in/IN which/WDT it/PRPS*3 subsists/VBZ ./.
For/IN the/DT subject/NN of/IN it/PRPS*3 is/VBZ intellect/NN ,/, and/CC it/PRPS*3 is/VBZ itself/PRPSR3 intellect/NN ./. ./. ./. ./.
In/IN this/DT*S sensible/JJ region/NN ,/, therefore/RB ,/, one/CD1 part/NN is/VBZ not/RB produced/VBN by/IN another/DT+JJ ,/, but/CC each/DTCS part/NN is/VBZ alone/RB a/DTCS part/NN ./.
But/CC there/EX each/DTCS part/NN always/RB proceeds/NNS from/IN the/DT whole/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ at/IN the/DT same/JJ each/DTCS time/NN part/NN and/CC the/DT whole/NN ./.
For/IN it/PRPS*3 appears/VBZ indeed/RB as/IN a/DTCS part/NN ./.
but/CC by/IN him/PRPSO3 whose/WP$ sight/NN is/VBZ acute/JJ ,/, it/PRPS*3 will/MD be/VB seen/VBN as/IN a/DTCS whole/NN ./.
Where/WRB ./. ./. ./.
is/VBZ likewise/RB no/DT weariness/NN of/IN the/DT vision/NN which/WDT Is/VBZ there/EX ,/, not/RB any/DT** plenitude/NN of/IN perception/NN which/WDT can/MD bring/VB intuition/NN to/TO an/DTCS end/NN ./.
For/IN neither/DTCS was/NNS there/EX any/DT** vacuity/NN which/WDT when/WRB filled/VBN might/MD cause/NN the/DT visible/JJ energy/NN to/TO cease/VB ./.
nor/CC is/VBZ this/DT*S one/CD1 thing/NN ,/, but/CC that/IN another/DT+JJ ,/, so/RB as/IN to/TO occasion/NN a/DTCS part/NN of/IN one/CD1 thing/NN not/RB to/TO be/VB amicable/JJ with/IN that/IN of/IN another/DT+JJ ./.
Where/WRB ./. ./. ./.
the/DT life/NN is/VBZ wisdom/NN ./.
a/DTCS wisdom/NN not/RB obtained/VBN by/IN a/DTCS reasoning/VBG process/NN ,/, because/CC the/DT whole/JJ of/IN it/PRPS*3 always/RB was/VBD ,/, and/CC is/VBZ not/RB in/IN any/DT** respect/NN deficient/JJ ,/, so/RB as/IN to/TO be/VB in/IN want/VBP of/IN investigation/NN ./.
But/CC it/PRPS*3 is/VBZ the/DT first/JJ wisdom/NN ,/, and/CC is/VBZ not/RB derived/VBN from/IN another/DT+JJ ./.
I/PRPSS1 understood/VBN that/IN all/DT** the/DT radiance/NN here/RB is/VBZ thought/VBD ./.
and/CC the/DT changing/VBG colours/NNS are/are emotions/NNS ./.
And/CC each/DTCS ray/NN ,/, if/IF we/PRPPS1 look/VB into/IN it/PRPS*3 ,/, turns/VBZ into/IN images/NNS ,/, symbols/NNS ,/, voices/NNS and/CC moods/NNS ./.
And/CC I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD that/IN there/EX is/VBZ nothing/NN inanimate/JJ ,/, but/CC all/DT** is/VBZ soul/NN ,/, all/DT** is/VBZ life/NN ,/, all/DT** is/VBZ emotion/NN and/CC imagination/NN ./.
And/CC beneath/IN the/DT radiant/JJ stars/NNS beside/IN the/DT blue/JJ river/NN I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD a/DTCS naked/JJ maiden/NN ,/, young/JJ and/CC beautiful/JJ ./.
She/PRPSS3 stooped/VBD on/IN one/CD1 knee/NN and/CC poured/VBD water/NN from/IN two/CD vessels/NNS ,/, one/CD1 of/IN gold/NN and/CC one/CD1 of/IN silver/NN ./.
A/DTCS little/JJ bird/NN in/IN a/DTCS near/IN by/IN bush/NN lifted/VBD its/PRP$* wings/NNS and/CC was/VBD poised/VBN ready/JJ to/TO fly/RB away/RB ./.

But/CC by/IN and/CC by/IN the/DT disciples/NNS forgot/VBD the/DT true/JJ covenant/NN of/IN the/DT Master/NNP and/CC what/WP the/DT tower/NN symbolized/VBD ,/, and/CC began/VBD to/TO believe/VBP in/IN the/DT tower/NN of/IN stone/NN ,/, they/PRPPS3 had/VBD built/VBN ,/, and/CC to/TO teach/VB others/NNS to/TO so/RB believe/VBP ./.

And/CC so/RB they/PRPPS3 waited/VBD in/IN the/DT tower/NN for/IN the/DT Master/NNP ./.
Others/NNS did/VBD not/RB believe/VBP this/DT*S ,/, or/CC interpreted/VBN it/PRPS*3 differently/RB ./.
Then/RB began/VBD disputes/NNS about/IN the/DT rights/NNS of/IN the/DT summit/NN ./.
Quarrels/NNS started/VBD ,/, Our/PRP$JJ Master/NNP ,/, your/PRP$JJ Master/NNP ,/, was/VBD said/VBD ./.
our/PRP$JJ tower/NN ,/, your/PRP$JJ tower/NN ./.
And/CC the/DT disciples/NNS ceased/VBD to/TO understand/VB each_other/PRPSC3 ./.
Their/PRP$JJ tongues/NNS had/VBD become/VB confused/VBN ./.
You/PRP*2 understand/VB the/DT meaning/VBG here/RB ?/?
They/PRPPS3 had/VBD begun/VBN to/TO think/VBP that/IN this/DT*S is/VBZ the/DT tower/NN of/IN the/DT Master/NNP ,/, that/IN He/PRPSS3 builds/VBZ it/PRPS*3 through/IN them/PRPPO3 ,/, and/CC that/IN it/PRPS*3 must/MD and/CC ,/, indeed/RB ,/, can/MD be/VB built/VBN right/NN up/IN to/TO Heaven/NNP ./.

In/IN the/DT midst/NN of/IN a/DTCS green/JJ plain/JJ ,/, surrounded/VBN by/IN blue/JJ hills/NNS ,/, I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD a/DTCS woman/NN with/IN a/DTCS lion/NN ./.

This/DT*S is/VBZ a/DTCS picture/NN of/IN power/NN ,/, said/VBD the/DT voice/NN ./.
It/PRPS*3 has/VBZ different/JJ meanings/NNS ./.
First/JJ it/PRPS*3 shows/VBZ the/DT power/NN of/IN love/NN ./.
Love/NNP alone/RB can/MD conquer/VB wrath/NN ./.
Hatred/NN feeds/VBZ hatred/NN ./.
Remember/VB what/WP Zarathustra/NNP said/VBD ./.
Let/VB man/NN be/VB freed/VBN from/IN vengeance/NN ./.
this/DT*S is/VBZ a/DTCS bridge/NN for/IN me/PRPSO1 which/WDT leads/VBZ to/TO higher/JJR hope/NN and/CC a/DTCS rainbow/NN in/IN heaven/NN after/IN long/JJ storms/NNS ./.
Then/RB it/PRPS*3 shows/VBZ power/NN of/IN unity/NN ./.
These/DT*P wreaths/NNS of/IN roses/NNS suggest/VBP a/DTCS magic/NN chain/NN ./.
Unity/NNP of/IN desires/NNS ,/, unity/NN of/IN aspirations/NNS creates/VBZ such/JJ power/NN that/IN every/DTCS wild/JJ ,/, uncontrolled/JJ ,/, unconscious/JJ force/NN is/VBZ subdued/VBN ./.
Even/RB two/CD desires/NNS ,/, if/IF united/VBN ,/, are/are able/JJ to/TO conquer/VB almost/RB the/DT whole/JJ world/NN ./.
The/DT picture/NN also/RB shows/VBZ the/DT power/NN of/IN infinity/NN ,/, that/IN sphere/NN of/IN mysteries/NNS ./.
For/IN a/DTCS consciousness/NN that/IN perceives/VBZ the/DT symbol/NN of/IN infinity/NN above/IN it/PRPS*3 ,/, knows/VBZ no/DT obstacles/NNS and/CC cannot/MD be/VB withstood/VBD ./.
THE/DT DEVIL/NN ./.
Black/JJ ,/, awful/JJ night/NN enveloped/VBN the/DT earth/NN ./.
An/DTCS ominous/JJ ,/, red/JJ flame/NN burned/VBN in/IN the/DT distance/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 was/VBD approaching/VBG a/DTCS fantastic/JJ figure/NN which/WDT outlined/VBN itself/PRPSR3 before/IN me/PRPSO1 as/IN I/PRPSS1 came/VBD nearer/JJR to/TO it/PRPS*3 ./.
High/NNP above/IN the/DT earth/NN appeared/VBD the/DT repulsive/JJ red/JJ face/NN of/IN the/DT Devil/NNP ,/, with/IN large/JJ ,/, hairy/JJ ears/NNS ,/, pointed/VBD beard/NN and/CC curved/JJ goats/NNS '/" horns/NNS ./.
A/DTCS pentagram/NN ,/, pointing/VBG downwards/NN ,/, shone/VBD in/IN phosphoric/NN light/NN between/IN the/DT horns/NNS on/IN his/PRP$* forehead/NN ./.
Two/CD large/JJ ,/, grey/JJ ,/, bat-like/JJ wings/NNS were/VBD spread/NN behind/IN him/PRPSO3 ./.
He/PRPSS3 held/VBN up/IN one/CD1 arm/NN ,/, spreading/VBG out/IN his/PRP$* bare/JJ ,/, fat/JJ hand/NN ./.
In/IN the/DT palm/NN I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD the/DT sign/NN of/IN black/JJ magic/NN ./.
A/DTCS burning/VBG torch/NN held/VBN down-end/JJ in/IN his/PRP$* other/JJ hand/NN emitted/VBN black/JJ ,/, stifling/VBG smoke/NN ./.
He/PRPSS3 sat/VBD on/IN a/DTCS large/JJ ,/, black/JJ cube/NN ,/, gripping/VBG it/PRPS*3 with/IN the/DT claws/NNS of/IN his/PRP$* beast-like/JJ ,/, shaggy/JJ legs/NNS ./.
A/DTCS man/NN and/CC woman/NN were/VBD chained/VBD to/TO the/DT cube/NN ,/, the/DT same/JJ Man/NN and/CC Woman/NNP I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD in/IN the/DT garden/NN ,/, but/CC now/RB they/PRPPS3 had/VBD horns/NNS and/CC tails/NNS tipped/VBD with/IN flame/NN ./.
And/CC they/PRPPS3 were/VBD evidently/RB dissatisfied/JJ in/IN spirit/NN ,/, and/CC were/VBD filled/VBN with/IN protest/NN and/CC repulsion/NN ./.
This/DT*S is/VBZ a/DTCS picture/NN of/IN weakness/NN ,/, said/VBD the/DT voice/NN ,/, a/DTCS picture/NN of/IN falsehood/NN and/CC evil/JJ ./.
They/PRPPS3 are/are the/DT same/JJ man/NN and/CC woman/NN you/PRP*2 saw/VBD in/IN the/DT garden/NN ,/, but/CC their/PRP$JJ love/NN ceasing/VBG to/TO be/VB a/DTCS sacrifice/NN ,/, became/VBD an/DTCS illusion/NN ./.
This/DT*S man/NN and/CC woman/NN forgot/VBD that/IN their/PRP$JJ love/NN is/VBZ a/DTCS link/NN in/IN the/DT chain/NN that/IN unites/VBZ them/PRPPO3 with/IN eternity/NN ,/, that/IN their/PRP$JJ love/NN is/VBZ a/DTCS symbol/NN of/IN equilibrium/NN and/CC a/DTCS road/NN to/TO Infinity/NN ./.
They/PRPPS3 forgot/VBD that/IN It/PRPS*3 is/VBZ a/DTCS key/NN to/TO the/DT gate/NN of/IN the/DT magic/JJ world/NN ,/, the/DT torch/NN which/WDT lights/VBZ the/DT higher/JJR Path/NNP ./.
They/PRPPS3 forgot/VBD that/IN Love/NNP is/VBZ real/JJ and/CC immortal/JJ and/CC they/PRPPS3 subjugated/VBD it/PRPS*3 to/TO the/DT unreal/JJ and/CC temporary/JJ ./.
And/CC they/PRPPS3 each/DTCS made/VBN love/NN a/DTCS tool/NN for/IN submitting/VBG the/DT other/JJ to/TO himself/PRPSR3 ./.
Then/RB love/NN became/VBD dissension/NN and/CC fettered/VBN them/PRPPO3 with/IN iron/JJ chains/NNS to/TO the/DT black/JJ cube/NN of/IN matter/NN ,/, on/IN which/WDT sits/VBZ deceit/NN ./.
And/CC I/PRPSS1 heard/VBN the/DT voice/NN of/IN the/DT Devil/NNP ./.
I/PRPSS1 am/am Evil/NNP ,/, he/PRPSS3 said/VBD ,/, at/IN least/JJS so/RB far/RB as/IN Evil/NNP can/MD exist/VB in/IN this/DT*S best/JJS of/IN worlds/NNS ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO see/VB me/PRPSO1 ,/, one/CD1 must/MD be/VB able/JJ to/TO see/VB unfairly/RB ,/, incorrectly/RB and/CC narrowly/RB ./.
I/PRPSS1 close/VB the/DT triangle/NN ,/, the/DT other/JJ two/CD sides/NNS of/IN which/WDT are/are Death/NN and/CC Time/NNP ./.
In/IN order/NN to/TO quit/VB this/DT*S triangle/NN it/PRPS*3 is/VBZ necessary/JJ to/TO see/VB that/IN it/PRPS*3 does/VBZ not/RB exist/VB ./.
But/CC how/WRB to/TO do/do this/DT*S is/VBZ not/RB for/IN me/PRPSO1 to/TO tell/VB ./.
For/IN I/PRPSS1 am/am the/DT Evil/NNP which/WDT men/NNS say/VBP is/VBZ the/DT cause/NN of/IN all/DT** evil/NN and/CC which/WDT they/PRPPS3 invented/VBN as/IN an/DTCS excuse/NN for/IN all/DT** the/DT evil/NN that/IN they/PRPPS3 do/do ./.
They/PRPPS3 call/VB me/PRPSO1 the/DT Prince/NNP of/IN Falsehood/NN ,/, and/CC truly/RB I/PRPSS1 am/am the/DT prince/NN of/IN lies/NNS ,/, because/CC I/PRPSS1 am/am the/DT most/JJS monstrous/JJ production/NN of/IN human/JJ lies/NNS ./.
THE/DT HERMIT/NNP ./.
After/IN long/JJ wanderings/NNS over/IN a/DTCS sandy/JJ ,/, waterless/JJ desert/NN where/WRB only/RB serpents/NNS lived/VBD ,/, I/PRPSS1 met/VBD the/DT Hermit/NNP ./.
He/PRPSS3 was/VBD wrapped/VBN in/IN a/DTCS long/JJ cloak/NN ,/, a/DTCS hood/NN thrown/VBN over/IN his/PRP$* head/NN ./.
He/PRPSS3 held/VBN a/DTCS long/JJ staff/NN in/IN one/CD1 hand/NN and/CC in/IN the/DT other/JJ a/DTCS lighted/VBN lantern/NN ,/, though/IN it/PRPS*3 was/VBD broad/JJ daylight/NN and/CC the/DT sun/NN was/VBD shining/VBG ./.
The/DT lantern/NN of/IN Hermes/NNP Trismegistus/NNP ,/, said/VBD the/DT voice/NN ,/, this/DT*S is/VBZ higher/JJR knowledge/NN ,/, that/IN inner/JJ knowledge/NN which/WDT illuminates/VBZ in/IN a/DTCS new/JJ way/NN even/RB what/WP appears/VBZ to/TO be/VB already/RB clearly/RB known/VBN ./.
This/DT*S lantern/NN lights/VBZ up/IN the/DT past/NN ,/, the/DT present/NN and/CC the/DT future/NN for/IN the/DT Hermit/NNP ,/, and/CC opens/VBZ the/DT souls/NNS of/IN people/NNS and/CC the/DT most/RBS intimate/JJ recesses/NNS ./.
of/IN their/PRP$JJ hearts/NNS ./.
The/DT cloak/NN of/IN Apollonius/NNP is/VBZ the/DT faculty/NN of/IN the/DT wise/JJ man/NN by/IN which/WDT he/PRPSS3 isolates/VBZ himself/PRPSR3 ,/, even/RB amidst/IN a/DTCS noisy/JJ crowd/NN ./.
it/PRPS*3 is/VBZ his/PRP$* skill/NN in/IN hiding/VBG his/PRP$* mysteries/NNS ,/, even/RB while/IN expressing/VBG them/PRPPO3 ,/, his/PRP$* capacity/NN for/IN silence/NN and/CC his/PRP$* power/NN to/TO act/NN in/IN stillness/NN ./.
The/DT staff/NN of/IN the/DT patriarchs/NNS is/VBZ his/PRP$* inner/JJ authority/NN ,/, his/PRP$* power/NN ,/, his/PRP$* self-confidence/NN ./.
The/DT lantern/NN ,/, the/DT cloak/NN and/CC the/DT staff/NN are/are the/DT three/CD symbols/NNS of/IN initiation/NN ./.
They/PRPPS3 are/are needed/VBN to/TO guide/NN souls/NNS past/RB the/DT temptation/NN of/IN illusory/JJ fires/NNS by/IN the/DT roadside/NN ,/, so/RB that/IN they/PRPPS3 may/MD go/VB straight/RB to/TO the/DT higher/JJR goal/NN ./.
He/PRPSS3 who/WP receives/VBZ these/DT*P three/CD symbols/NNS or/CC aspires/VBZ to/TO obtain/VB them/PRPPO3 ,/, strives/VBZ to/TO enrich/VB himself/PRPSR3 with/IN all/DT** he/PRPSS3 can/MD acquire/VB ,/, not/RB for/IN himself/PRPSR3 ,/, but/CC ,/, like/IN God/NNP ,/, to/TO delight/NN in/IN the/DT joy/NN of/IN giving/VBG ./.
The/DT giving/VBG virtue/NN is/VBZ the/DT basis/NN of/IN an/DTCS initiate/NN '/" s/PRP$S life/NN ./.
His/PRP$* soul/NN is/VBZ transformed/VBN into/IN a/DTCS spoiler/NN of/IN all/DT** treasures/NNS '/XX so/RB said/VBD Zarathustra/NNP ./.
Initiation/NN unites/VBZ the/DT human/JJ mind/NN with/IN the/DT higher/JJR mind/NN by/IN a/DTCS chain/NN of/IN analogies/NNS ./.
This/DT*S chain/NN is/VBZ the/DT ladder/NN leading/VBG to/TO heaven/NN ,/, dreamed/VBD of/IN by/IN the/DT patriarch/NN ./.
TIME/NN (/XX TEMPERANCE/NN )/XX ./.
An/DTCS angel/NN in/IN a/DTCS white/JJ robe/NN ,/, touching/VBG earth/NN and/CC heaven/NN ,/, appeared/VBD ./.
His/PRP$* wings/NNS were/VBD flame/JJ and/CC a/DTCS radiance/NN of/IN gold/NN was/VBD about/IN his/PRP$* head/NN ./.
On/IN his/PRP$* breast/NN he/PRPSS3 wore/VBD the/DT sacred/JJ sign/NN of/IN the/DT book/NN of/IN the/DT Tarot/NNP ,/, a/DTCS triangle/NN within/IN a/DTCS square/NN ,/, a/DTCS point/NN within/IN the/DT triangle/NN ./.
on/IN his/PRP$* forehead/NN the/DT symbol/NN of/IN life/NN and/CC eternity/NN ,/, the/DT circle/NN ./.
In/IN one/CD1 hand/NN was/VBD a/DTCS cup/NN of/IN silver/NN ,/, in/IN the/DT other/JJ a/DTCS cup/NN of/IN gold/NN and/CC there/EX flowed/VBD between/IN these/DT*P cups/NNS a/DTCS constant/JJ ,/, glistening/VBG stream/NN of/IN every/DTCS colour/NN of/IN the/DT rainbow/NN ./.
But/CC I/PRPSS1 could/MD not/RB tell/VB from/IN which/WDT cup/NN nor/CC into/IN which/WDT cup/NN the/DT stream/NN flowed/VBD ./.
In/IN great/JJ awe/NN I/PRPSS1 understood/VBN that/IN I/PRPSS1 was/VBD near/IN the/DT ultimate/JJ mysteries/NNS from/IN which/WDT there/EX is/VBZ no/DT return/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 looked/VBD upon/IN the/DT angel/NN ,/, upon/IN his/PRP$* symbols/NNS ,/, his/PRP$* cups/NNS ,/, the/DT rainbow/NN stream/NN between/IN the/DT cups/NNS and/CC my/PRP$JJ human/JJ heart/NN trembled/VBD with/IN fear/NN and/CC my/PRP$JJ human/JJ mind/NN shrank/VBD with/IN anguish/NN and/CC lack/NN of/IN understanding/VBG ./.
Yes/UH ,/, said/VBD the/DT voice/NN ,/, this/DT*S is/VBZ a/DTCS mystery/NN that/IN is/VBZ revealed/VBD at/IN Initiation/NN ./.
Initiation/NN is/VBZ simply/RB the/DT revealing/VBG of/IN this/DT*S mystery/NN in/IN the/DT soul/NN ./.
The/DT Hermit/NNP receives/VBZ the/DT lantern/NN ,/, the/DT cloak/NN and/CC the/DT staff/NN so/RB that/IN he/PRPSS3 can/MD bear/VB the/DT light/NN of/IN this/DT*S mystery/NN ./.
But/CC you/PRP*2 probably/RB came/VBD here/RB unprepared/JJ ./.
Look/VB then/RB and/CC listen/VB and/CC try/VB to/TO understand/VB ,/, for/IN now/RB understanding/VBG is/VBZ your/PRP$JJ only/RB salvation/NN ./.
He/PRPSS3 who/WP approaches/NNS the/DT mystery/NN without/IN complete/JJ comprehension/NN will/MD be/VB lost/VBD ./.
The/DT name/NN of/IN the/DT angel/NN is/VBZ Time/NNP ./.
The/DT circle/NN on/IN his/PRP$* forehead/NN is/VBZ the/DT symbol/NN of/IN eternity/NN and/CC life/NN ./.
Each/DTCS life/NN is/VBZ a/DTCS circle/NN which/WDT returns/VBZ to/TO the/DT same/JJ point/NN where/WRB it/PRPS*3 began/VBD ./.
Death/NN is/VBZ the/DT return/NN to/TO birth/NN ./.
And/CC from/IN one/CD1 point/NN to/TO another/DT+JJ on/IN the/DT circumference/NN of/IN a/DTCS circle/NN the/DT distance/NN is/VBZ always/RB the/DT same/JJ ,/, and/CC the/DT further/JJ it/PRPS*3 is/VBZ from/IN one/CD1 point/NN ,/, the/DT nearer/JJR it/PRPS*3 will/MD be/VB to/TO the/DT other/JJ ./.
Eternity/NN is/VBZ a/DTCS serpent/NN ,/, pursuing/VBG its/PRP$* tail/NN ,/, never/RB catching/VBG it/PRPS*3 ./.
One/NNP of/IN the/DT cups/NNS the/DT angel/NN holds/VBZ is/VBZ the/DT past/JJ ,/, the/DT other/JJ is/VBZ the/DT future/NN ./.
The/DT rainbow/NN stream/NN between/IN the/DT cups/NNS is/VBZ the/DT present/JJ ./.
You/PRP*2 see/VB that/IN it/PRPS*3 flows/NNS both/DTCP ways/NNS ./.
This/DT*S is/VBZ Time/NNP in/IN its/PRP$* most/RBS incomprehensible/JJ aspect/NN ./.
Men/NNS think/VBP that/IN all/DT** flows/NNS constantly/RB in/IN one/CD1 direction/NN ./.
They/PRPPS3 do/do not/RB see/VB that/IN everything/VBG perpetually/RB meets/VBZ and/CC that/IN Time/NNP is/VBZ a/DTCS multitude/NN of/IN turning/VBG circles/NNS ./.
Understand/VB this/DT*S mystery/NN and/CC learn/VB to/TO discern/VB the/DT contrary/JJ currents/NNS in/IN the/DT rainbow/JJ stream/NN of/IN the/DT present/NN ./.
The/DT symbol/NN of/IN the/DT sacred/JJ book/NN of/IN the/DT Tarot/NNP on/IN the/DT angel/NN '/" s/PRP$S breast/NN is/VBZ the/DT symbol/NN of/IN the/DT correlation/NN of/IN God/NNP ,/, Man/NN and/CC the/DT Universe/NNP ./.
The/DT triangle/NN is/VBZ God/NNP ,/, the/DT world/NN of/IN spirit/NN ,/, the/DT world/NN of/IN ideas/NNS ./.
The/DT point/NN within/IN the/DT triangle/NN is/VBZ the/DT soul/NN of/IN man/NN ./.
The/DT square/NN is/VBZ the/DT visible/JJ world/NN ./.
The/DT consciousness/NN of/IN man/NN is/VBZ the/DT spark/NN of/IN divinity/NN ,/, a/DTCS point/NN within/IN the/DT triangle/NN of/IN spirit/NN ./.
Therefore/RB the/DT whole/JJ square/NN of/IN the/DT visible/JJ universe/NN is/VBZ equal/JJ to/TO the/DT point/NN within/IN the/DT triangle/NN ./.
The/DT world/NN of/IN spirit/NN is/VBZ the/DT triangle/NN of/IN the/DT twenty-one/CD signs/NNS of/IN the/DT Tarot/NNP ./.
The/DT square/NN represents/VBZ fire/NN ,/, air/NN ,/, water/NN and/CC earth/NN ,/, and/CC thus/RB symbolises/VBZ the/DT world/NN ./.
All/DT** this/DT*S ,/, in/IN the/DT form/NN of/IN the/DT four/CD symbols/NNS ,/, is/VBZ in/IN the/DT bag/NN of/IN the/DT Fool/NN ,/, who/WP himself/PRPSR3 is/VBZ a/DTCS point/NN in/IN a/DTCS triangle/NN ./.
Therefore/RB a/DTCS point/NN without/IN dimension/NN contains/VBZ an/DTCS infinite/JJ square/NN ./.
THE/DT WHEEL/NN OF/IN CHANCE/NN ./.
I/PRPSS1 walked/VBD along/IN ,/, absorbed/VBN in/IN deep/JJ thought/VBD ,/, trying/VBG to/TO understand/VB the/DT vision/NN of/IN the/DT Angel/NNP ./.
And/CC suddenly/RB ,/, as/IN I/PRPSS1 lifted/VBD my/PRP$JJ head/NN ,/, I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD midway/RB in/IN the/DT sky/NN a/DTCS huge/JJ ,/, revolving/VBG circle/NN covered/VBN with/IN Kabalistic/JJ letters/NNS and/CC symbols/NNS ./.
The/DT circle/NN turned/VBD with/IN terrible/JJ velocity/NN ,/, and/CC around/IN it/PRPS*3 ,/, falling/VBG down/RB and/CC flying/VBG up/IN ,/, symbolic/JJ figures/NNS of/IN the/DT serpent/NN and/CC the/DT dog/NN revolved/VBD ./.

In/IN clouds/NNS ,/, on/IN the/DT four/CD quarters/NNS of/IN heaven/NN ,/, I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD the/DT four/CD apocalyptical/JJ beings/NNS ,/, one/CD1 with/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN a/DTCS lion/NN ,/, another/DT+JJ with/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN a/DTCS bull/NN ,/, the/DT third/JJ with/IN a/DTCS face/NN of/IN an/DTCS eagle/NN ,/, and/CC the/DT fourth/JJ with/IN the/DT face/NN of/IN a/DTCS bull/NN ./.

All/DT** go/VB ,/, all/DT** return/VB ,/, the/DT wheel/NN of/IN life/NN ever/RB turns/VBZ ./.

The/DT heavy/JJ hoofs/NNS of/IN the/DT horse/NN seemed/VBD to/TO step/NN on/IN my/PRP$JJ breast/NN ,/, and/CC I/PRPSS1 felt/VBD the/DT world/NN sink/VB into/IN an/DTCS abyss/NN ./.
But/CC all/DT** at/IN once/RB something/NN familiar/JJ ,/, but/CC faintly/RB seen/VBN and/CC heard/VBN ,/, seemed/VBD to/TO come/VB from/IN the/DT measured/JJ step/NN of/IN the/DT horse/NN ./.
A/DTCS moment/NN more/JJR and/CC I/PRPSS1 heard/VBN in/IN his/PRP$* steps/NNS the/DT movement/NN of/IN the/DT Wheel/NNP of/IN Life/NNP !/!
An/DTCS illumination/NN entered/VBD me/PRPSO1 ,/, and/CC ,/, looking/VBG at/IN the/DT receding/VBG rider/NN and/CC the/DT descending/VBG sun/NN ,/, I/PRPSS1 understood/VBN that/IN the/DT Path/NNP of/IN Life/NNP consists/VBZ of/IN the/DT steps/NNS of/IN the/DT horse/NN of/IN Death/NN ./.
The/DT sun/NN sinks/VBZ at/IN one/CD1 point/NN and/CC rises/VBZ at/IN another/DT+JJ ./.
Each/DTCS moment/NN of/IN its/PRP$* motion/NN is/VBZ a/DTCS descent/NN at/IN one/CD1 point/NN and/CC an/DTCS ascent/NN at/IN another/DT+JJ ./.
I/PRPSS1 understood/VBN that/IN it/PRPS*3 rises/VBZ while/IN sinking/VBG and/CC sinks/VBZ while/IN rising/VBG ,/, and/CC that/IN life/NN ,/, in/IN coming/VBG to/TO birth/NN ,/, dies/VBZ ,/, and/CC in/IN dying/VBG ,/, comes/VBZ to/TO birth/NN ./.
Yes/UH ,/, said/VBD the/DT voice/NN ./.
The/DT sun/NN does/VBZ not/RB think/VBP of/IN its/PRP$* going/VBG down/RB and/CC coming/VBG up/IN ./.
What/WP does/VBZ it/PRPS*3 know/VB of/IN earth/NN ,/, of/IN the/DT going/VBG and/CC coming/VBG observed/VBN by/IN men/NNS ?/?
It/PRPS*3 goes/VBZ its/PRP$* own/JJ way/NN ,/, over/IN its/PRP$* own/JJ orbit/NN ,/, round/RB an/DTCS unknown/JJ Centre/NNP ./.
Life/NNP ,/, death/NN ,/, rising/VBG and/CC falling/VBG ,/, do/do you/PRP*2 not/RB know/VB that/IN all/DT** these/DT*P things/NNS are/are thoughts/NNS and/CC dreams/NNS and/CC fears/NNS of/IN the/DT Fool/NN ?/?
JUSTICE/NN ./.
When/WRB I/PRPSS1 possessed/VBD the/DT keys/NNS ,/, read/VB the/DT book/NN and/CC understood/VBN the/DT symbols/NNS ,/, I/PRPSS1 was/VBD permitted/VBN to/TO lift/VB the/DT curtain/NN of/IN the/DT Temple/NNP and/CC enter/VB ./.
its/PRP$* inner/JJ sanctum/NN ./.
And/CC there/EX I/PRPSS1 beheld/VBD a/DTCS Woman/NNP with/IN a/DTCS crown/NN of/IN gold/NN and/CC a/DTCS purple/JJ mantle/NN ./.
She/PRPSS3 held/VBN a/DTCS sword/NN in/IN one/CD1 hand/NN and/CC scales/NNS in/IN the/DT other/JJ ./.
I/PRPSS1 trembled/VBD with/IN awe/NN at/IN her/PRP$JJ appearance/NN ,/, which/WDT was/VBD deep/JJ and/CC mysterious/JJ ,/, and/CC drew/VBD me/PRPSO1 like/IN an/DTCS abyss/NN ./.
You/PRP*2 see/VB Truth/NN ,/, said/VBD the/DT voice/NN ./.
On/IN these/DT*P scales/NNS everything/NN is/VBZ weighed/VBD ./.
This/DT*S sword/NN is/VBZ always/RB raised/VBN to/TO guard/NN justice/NN ,/, and/CC nothing/NN can/MD escape/VB it/PRPS*3 ./.
But/CC why/WRB do/do you/PRP*2 avert/VB your/PRP$JJ eyes/NNS from/IN the/DT scales/NNS and/CC the/DT sword/NN ?/?
They/PRPPS3 will/MD remove/VB the/DT last/JJ illusions/NNS ./.
How/WRB could/MD you/PRP*2 live/VB on/IN earth/NN without/IN these/DT*P illusions/NNS ?/?
You/PRP*2 wished/VBD to/TO see/VB Truth/NN and/CC now/RB you/PRP*2 behold/VB it/PRPS*3 !/!
But/CC remember/VB what/WP happens/VBZ to/TO the/DT mortal/NN who/WP beholds/VBZ a/DTCS Goddess/NNP !/!
THE/DT HANGED/VBN MAN/NNP ./.
And/CC then/RB I/PRPSS1 saw/VBD a/DTCS man/NN in/IN terrible/JJ suffering/VBG ,/, hung/VBD by/IN one/CD1 leg/NN ,/, head/NN downward/JJ ,/, to/TO a/DTCS high/JJ tree/NN ./.
Look/VB !/!
This/DT*S is/VBZ a/DTCS man/NN who/WP saw/VBD Truth/NN ./.
Suffering/VBG awaits/VBZ the/DT man/NN on/IN earth/NN ,/, who/WP finds/VBZ the/DT way/NN to/TO eternity/NN and/CC to/TO the/DT understanding/VBG of/IN the/DT Endless/NNP ./.
He/PRPSS3 is/VBZ still/RB a/DTCS man/NN ,/, but/CC he/PRPSS3 already/RB knows/VBZ much/JJ of/IN what/WP is/VBZ inaccessible/JJ even/RB to/TO Gods/NNPS ./.
And/CC the/DT incommensurableness/NN of/IN the/DT small/JJ and/CC the/DT great/JJ in/IN his/PRP$* soul/NN constitutes/VBZ his/PRP$* pain/NN and/CC his/PRP$* golgotha/NN ./.
In/IN his/PRP$* own/JJ soul/NN appears/VBZ the/DT gallows/NNS on/IN which/WDT he/PRPSS3 hangs/VBZ in/IN suffering/VBG ,/, feeling/VBG that/IN he/PRPSS3 is/VBZ indeed/RB inverted/JJ ./.
He/PRPSS3 chose/VBD this/DT*S way/NN himself/PRPSR3 ./.
For/IN this/DT*S he/PRPSS3 went/VBD over/IN a/DTCS long/JJ road/NN from/IN trial/NN to/TO trial/NN ,/, from/IN initiation/NN to/TO initiation/NN ,/, through/IN failures/NNS and/CC falls/NNS ./.
And/CC now/RB he/PRPSS3 has/VBZ found/VBD Truth/NN and/CC knows/VBZ himself/PRPSR3 ./.
He/PRPSS3 knows/VBZ that/IN it/PRPS*3 is/VBZ he/PRPSS3 who/WP stands/VBZ before/IN an/DTCS altar/NN with/IN magic/JJ symbols/NNS ,/, and/CC reaches/VBZ from/IN earth/NN to/TO heaven/NN ./.
that/IN he/PRPSS3 also/RB walks/VBZ on/IN a/DTCS dusty/JJ road/NN under/IN a/DTCS scorching/JJ sun/NN to/TO a/DTCS precipice/NN where/WRB a/DTCS crocodile/NN awaits/VBZ him/PRPSO3 ./.
that/IN he/PRPSS3 dwells/VBZ with/IN his/PRP$* mate/NN in/IN paradise/NN under/IN the/DT shadow/NN of/IN a/DTCS blessing/VBG genius/NNS ./.
that/IN he/PRPSS3 is/VBZ chained/VBD to/TO a/DTCS black/JJ cube/NN under/IN the/DT shadow/NN of/IN deceit/NN ./.
that/IN he/PRPSS3 stands/VBZ as/IN a/DTCS victor/NN for/IN a/DTCS moment/NN in/IN an/DTCS illusionary/JJ chariot/NN drawn/VBN by/IN sphinxes/NNS ./.
and/CC that/IN with/IN a/DTCS lantern/NN in/IN bright/JJ sunshine/NN ,/, he/PRPSS3 seeks/VBZ for/IN Truth/NN in/IN a/DTCS desert/NN ./.
Now/RB he/PRPSS3 has/VBZ found/VBD Her/PRPSO3 ./.
